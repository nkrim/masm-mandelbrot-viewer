Mandelbrot Viewer
=================
by Noah Krim and David West

The include path for SFML may need to be changed, depending on where it's installed on your local machine.
To do this, go to "Project Propeties > C/C++ > Additional Include Directories" and change the path to match your SFML installation.

Keybindings:
- WASD 		    - lateral movement
- Up/Down arrows    - zoom in/out 
- Left/Right arrows - halve/double iterations (adjusts fractal resolution)
- 0 / R 	    - reset viewer (only preserves color mode)
- 1	    	    - change color mode (blue/sepia)
- 2	    	    - change color mode (black and white, adjusted gradient)		
- 3	    	    - change color mode (black and white, iteration separation)
- 8		    - change color mode (trippy, outwards radiation)
- 9		    - change color mode (trippy, inwards radiation)
