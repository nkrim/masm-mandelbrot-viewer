# MASM Mandelbrot Viewer

An interactive viewer of the famous Mandelbrot fractal that is primarily coded in assembly with MASM as the assembler. Uses C++ and SFML as a program wrapper and window manager.

Extensively utilizes SSE SIMD instructions in order to parallelize the generation of the fractal image.

Supports zooming, panning, adjusting escape iteration count, and changing color modes.
